Here are some pre-trained models. I recorded my data in Pre-Trained model 2 through a **nose-cam** and models on Pre-Trained 1 are from **webcam**. People mostly use webcam so the Pre-trained model 1 might be a choice but not really reliable because it has to be according to the user. I didn't upload the data because the it's about 5000 images and the images are just low-resolution eye images.
